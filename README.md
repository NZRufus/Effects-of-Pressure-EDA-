# Effects-of-Pressure-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis on the effects of pressure on the mid range particle size (MRP) for investigating parameters to test.

This was initial analysis of data for membranes that were measured at P0 and P10 to try and detect if there were any relationships between the 2 measures (P0 and P10) and any parameters that could be used to identify outliers that would be abnormal membranes.
